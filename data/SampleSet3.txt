@WiseAndy was very improbable to start with. I was hoping for an \"iPad Pro\" once they announced the iPad Air *sigh*
So,  iPad Air  and  iPhone 5c  are the *new* categories Tim Cook was talking about?
Loved the event even more than I expected. T-10 days until I hopefully own a new iPad Air.
@seamus One iPad Air please.
I want an iPad air. :) #AppleEvent
iPad Air? What a waste of money... *adds iPad Air to Christmas list* #appletramp
@paulanderson24 iPad air is fantastic,new mini is running 64bit processing too so will run real smooth
So about this iPad Air....I'm about to buy the previous iPad. #AppleKeynote
Why did Apple rename the iPad to iPad Air? Thought there might be an iPad Pro 
@definetigers It was a joke to just me in which I thought,  500.00?! Long hair, iPad Air   Pretty pathetic, honestly. #LongHairiPadAir
But whatever. I guess I could buy the iPad Air and then sell it when new iPad minis are announced.
@faux_punk the iPad air is stunning!! Although I have a soft spot for the iPad mini with Retina #Geek
No pre-porders for iPad Air? :(
iPad line up... Keeping the iPad 2 (can't see the point) and the original Mini The new iPad 5 to be called iPad Air http://t.co/LOJqCpVg8K

In bed with the new iPad Air, being hit in the nose is no longer a concern. #fb
@rrbrambley if they don't already have iPad airs why are they your friends?
Slightly underwhelmed by new iPad announcements. iPad Air is a cool name, but it's iPad Mini with Retina that appeals.
iPad air
To make up for working Christmas Day I may have to buy myself an iPad air  
Amazing iPad Air http://t.co/ERlpxd9des    
Where is the iPad Air   [pic]   https://t.co/KClMbapxGD
@karptonite I guess, but what comes next year? iPad Air 2?
Ohh jesus, want and need everything announced during the last hour... iPad Air. YES! I think it would also iron your clothes if you asked it
Comfortly watching the Apple event at home with a beer... advantages of being on this side of the ocean. Amazing iPad Air!!!
New iPad Air look pretty cool
BBC News - Apple shows off thinner iPad Air http://t.co/BmzGkQ7dhZ  #ipad #apple

\"@DarrenCriss: Mmmmm new iPad Air... Nom nom gimme gimme  #Apple\" #geek
Tweetfeed penuh iPad Air. ;3
iPad Air!
Disappointed there's no new Apple TV. iPad Air looks nice but can't help but feel that tech innovation delivery is being cautiously managed
I'll wait until Black Friday to get the iPad air. Well, I'll try and wait
Apple shows off thinner iPad Air http://t.co/IQ4uQ9uhZG #business #marketing
iPad Air looks neat and all but it's not a difference maker much like the 5s/5c arent either. Apples innovation unfortunately died with Jobs
      Apple:  iPad Air: http://t.co/jvOTbSV25o  The New iPad Mini: http://t.co/9WlLNWJNNL 
iPad air
Ipad air the first and only thing Apple announced this year that I wanted
The biggest deal now is iPad Air or iPad mini?
Apple announce brand new iPad Air &amp; iPad Mini with Retina Display
iPad Air (5th Gen) &amp; New iPad Mini with Retina Display... [pic]   https://t.co/CgktQmVeKn
Hmm...seems that I can't decide which iPad I want since Apple unveiled them this morning. The iPad Air or the iPad Mini?? I can't decide.  
Welcome iPad Air &amp; iPad mini 2!
iPad Air on T-Mobile has 200 MB per month for free.
so tempted to get the new iPad air  
Hmm...seems that I can't decide which iPad I want since Apple unveiled them this morning. The iPad Air or the iPad Mini?? Help!!  
#ipad air - shut up and take my money!!!
In any case, I'll be on a road trip when the iPad Air drops. Could buy, but would have mobile migration issues. It can wait 'til I'm home.
iPad Air, I love You  
iPad Air!
@steenbras I know - they seemed way too stilted and nervous for those announcements  Think the iPad Air name is unnecessary as well.
Soooo will there be a 64gb iPad Air, or does it only come in 16GB? If so, then that's stupid. 
for me calling it an iPad Air makes complete sense, it's an evolution of the macbook air at this stage #ipadair #Applekeynote
Apple #iPad Air http://t.co/CLOj5YHP69
Its 00:00 IST And what I can see in my mob twitter app Apple iPad Air is trending, prices start at $499 for the 16GB WiFi edition.
That new iPad air tho&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Torn between the iPad mini with Retina Display and the iPad Air
I think the iPad Air is going to be the first iPad I'm going to skip. Just will go for the mini retina.
\"iPad Air\" leaves scope for an \"iPad Pro\".
British Empire @khayadlanga: Malawi getting the iPad Air before South Africa.
New iPad Air - I must have one !!! #ipadair
RT... @9to5mac: Apple announces the iPad Air: 20% thinner, 1-pound http://t.co/j9vtMV4WHX 
 @Mogale_Monareng: Then they give us the \"iPad Air\". Next thing, they'll be selling us air and calling it an iPad. #Apple #iPadAir Good idea
Here's your size comparison for iPad mini vs iPad Air. http://t.co/W3lL1fw99D
iPad Air. @ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts http://t.co/ttbjqYrBsV
Wonderfull the news about the new mac pro, macbook pro and iPad air !!!!! #AppleEvent  #Apple
@Agent_AlexRBR iPad Air! That's looks nice! (No touch ID) iPad mini with retina is  320, iPad mini now  250, iPad air normal price
@Bartelbyintpub The new name for the full-size iPad.  iPad Air  A total disappointment. No Touch ID on either iPad model.
iPad Air: faster, with not enough memory to hold all of Apple's built-in apps in the base model. Sheesh.
Thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever before\" the new iPad...is the iPad Air #Apple #iPad #iPadAir #ipadgames #tech #work #life
iPad air #wishlist too (at Ian's home) [pic]   https://t.co/G0u1epB6WT
New iPad Air noticeably lighter. From 1.4lbs to 1lb. http://t.co/wBDBzlCyz1
Finally, I LOVE the concept of the iPad Air's ad and how they showcased it's thinness!
iPad Air that sounds so sick!! http://t.co/d9MwD13oqp
Honestly, the only thing that excited me about the #AppleEvent was the iPad Air name. Shit sounds sexy. Won't buy it though.
@TheGadgetShow iPad air
iPad Air = iPad five. Sounds weird.

Great. Now I want an iPad Air. I think I have a problem...
iPad Air. Amazing. That is all.
@magsol: @write2run Apple just announced an \"iPad Air.\" I wish I was joking. iPad 5 was too simple!

Apple just announced their new iPad called iPad Air. It only weighs one pound :/
The new full-size iPad Air weighs one pound  #woah
Apple's new Retina iPad Mini also gets the A7 chip. So it is just as fast the iPad Air. http://t.co/1BxdKtxtij
iPad Air #hmmmm
iPad Air front camera upgrade = better selfies
Upon first hearing of the iPad air I was disappointed that theres a screen &amp; that I couldnt magically navigate via hologram Boo apple
The iPad Air is 72 times faster than the iPad 4? I didn't think you could get any faster than instantly fast, but okay...
@joetek I noticed all the same things. I also don't recall anyone leaking the iPad Air name beforehand, so that was a surprise as well.
@Greg__Matthews first class? I can't afford an iPad Air mate!!!!
iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina are 7.5mm in depth. The original mini is 7.2mm in depth.
not gonna lie, The new iPad air looks amazing!
The new iPad air looks so good #apple #ipadair http://t.co/qasdeBkhSM
 @rossrubin: Mavericks is free. Air is free. iPad Air is not free.   
Well, the new iPad mini is definitely going to turn heads. For all intents and purposes, it's exactly like the \"new\" iPad Air only smaller
FACK! I WANT THE IPAD AIR!
iPad Air #Wow
iPad air?.. LOL
